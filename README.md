Music Buddy is a refactored and extended version of the original Coding Buddy focused to be a music-player like experience. A local LLM handles chat, while built-in TTS speaks responses and a VLC-backed player manages playlists and playback with playlist management, and automatic queuing. Users can upload MP3 files for music analysis and sorting, while the auto-playlist feature groups tracks by detected mood or energy for quick playback. The UI supports direct user intents (e.g., “play upbeat”).
